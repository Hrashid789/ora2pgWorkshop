# Why Migrating from Oracle to Azure PostgreSQL?
One of the common reasons to migrate from Oracle to Azure Postgres is compatibility because PostgreSQL PL/PGSQL is highly compatible with Oracle PL/SQL, lowering the migration cost and risk. Azure also offers fully managed services for PostgreSQL (PaaS) to take advantage of all the key pieces that are part of the underlying Azure relational database platform. It provides the same level of reliability across all these platforms.

In Postgres, you can target your Oracle migrations. If you have Oracle workloads that you want to migrate to Azure, but you don't want to convert to a SQL based solution, Postgres is more compatible with the work in Oracle and with making some more clear migration patterns.

### Workshop

In this workshop, you gain a better understanding of how to conduct a site analysis for a customer to compare cost, performance, and level of effort required to migrate from Oracle to PostgreSQL. This workshop has tailored database platform migration steps to assist you in this learning journey.  You will also design and build a proof of concept (POC) to help the customer take advantage of new  PostgreSQL features to improve performance and resiliency.
